OK i think im in the wrong place!   All I wanted to do was ask why I cant upload .jpg images to instagram
when using the app IGdm which I uploaded and installed today. It receives and sends texts Ok.  When I
try to upload an image, kit first says image being uploaded, then failed and make sure the oimage is
a .jpg.  It is.  Another thing: why is THIS  github file in 4 point font?  its so tiny its hard to read.
anyway happy thanksgiving/halloween/ bonfire night novenber 5th/Christmas to you all.
